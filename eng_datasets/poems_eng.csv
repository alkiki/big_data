"Gabdulla Tukay   My Legacy","My tired soul, let peace be your reward,
It’s time to go to Allah, meet the Lord. 
Lift up your head; reveal your honest eyes,
Then take one final look into the skies. 
My friends, let mullahs heed my last request 
For them to sing my verse, when I am put to rest."
"Gabdulla Tukay   The Reply","Pushkin and Lermontov, two poets, two stars…
The third one is Tukai, he comes from the Tatars.
The venom you just drank exacerbates the pain,
Dreams of fortune and fame drive you insane.
The sea is infinite, no matter how you try,
You spill the water, and your tongue is dry.
You, sordid, miserable creature, stay away
Find other dogs like you, and join the fray,
Bark from a distance at the Milky Way."
"Gabdulla Tukay   From Shakespeare","What is it sitting on my loved one’s cheek?
An arrogant fly somehow managed to sneak;
What a happy creature this fly must be
Almighty God, why couldn’t it be me?"
"Gabdulla Tukay   Winter, Farewell","Winter go away, we’re tired of the cold.
Welcome spring is here, her carriage is of gold.
Vanish, Santa Clause, keep safe your snowy beard,
Watch out for the flowers you hated and feared.
The spring does not need a rifle or a sword
Her suite of butterflies obeys her every word."
"Gabdulla Tukay   Miracle","“All magic ended with the Prophet’s death; and never
Will a camel rise from stone, and no endeavor 
The moon’s great sphere shall split in two,” the sages say.
Should I believe them? Nay… A miracle occurred today.
It happened, that a friend of mine was passing by, 
And paid me back his debt – God only knows why!"
"Gabdulla Tukay   It Must Be Him","He’s the king of gossip, knows every tale.
Recently he bought a suit on sale.
A dandy, indeed, welcome everywhere,
Of his dancing prowess he’s quite aware.
No question, he knows how to snoop
In the paper you can read the scoop."
"Gabdulla Tukay   So Let Her Laugh","“Stop tormenting yourself: this girl is not for thee
She loves thee not, it is not meant to be.”
“Indeed, she makes a fool of me, I know,  
So what… Her teeth are white as snow. 
That pearly smile of hers, it is a fortune worth,
So let it brighten lives in heaven and earth.”"
"Gabdulla Tukay   Epitaph","I feel your heartbeat in my soul; you never died,
Your warmth and grace the two of us have tied,
And if you die, death is my only choice,
But while I breathe, I’ll hear your gentle voice.
You’re in my mind, yes, you are in my heart,
Not even death can break us two apart.
My love for you will never be surpassed,
And memories of it until my deathbed last."
"Gabdulla Tukay   Great Joy","Joyful you should be, men of Petersburg,
Same I want to wish to people in New York.
Hey, Berliner folks, where are your happy smiles?
Londoners, bring cheer to the gloomy British Isles.
I want to see you beaming, ‘shorties’ in Japan,
Finnish people and Chinese, it’s time to have some fun.
There is just one, who all of you could spare,
He’s Musa, Allah’s envoy, so better be aware."
"Gabdulla Tukay   Not All That Glitters Is Gold","At night a dazzling, splashy butterfly
Over the flowers joyfully would fly.
Then, once, he noticed something from afar,
Twas shimmering and shining, like a little star.
The butterfly loved beauty. In pure exultation 
He swiftly flew toward the amazing radiation.
It was a tiny ember in the bonfire left by a stranger, 
Landing on it the butterfly died, unaware of danger."
"Gabdulla Tukay   Summer Morning","It is getting lighter, violet morning nears,
While the hazy crescent in sadness disappears. 
The stars up in the skies melting away in peace,
The leaves start rustling, patted by the gentle breeze.
Abundant sunshine over night prevails,
Rips off its gloomy garb, the rolling field unveils, 
The lakes now sparkling like a magic glass,
Tired of waiting endlessly for the night to pass.
Lilies giggle with glee like in a fairy tale,
Nightingales in their songs the brilliant morning hail.
Clouds in the heavens stay as if they were on duty,
Marveling from above at nature’s endless beauty.
True, one can’t help the summer morning to admire,
Poet, this glorious time should your talent inspire."
"Gabdulla Tukay   Hard Work","My child, work hard until day comes to an end,
That’s what Allah wants, for that he will commend.
After a fruitful day you will sleep well at night,
Get up in the morning and learn to read and write.
Go on with your work, rest on Friday, my son,
Awakening the dawn – that’s the job of the sun.
Yesterday it worked and tomorrow, too, it will,
After getting tired it shall hide behind a hill.
The sun needs some rest and so does the earth,
Hard work will make you into a man of great worth.
It is a chance for you on earth to find your berth."
"Gabdulla Tukay   Repentance","I met some charismatic men who from within were rotten, 
Godless people to avoid – this rule I had forgotten.
By their deceptive smiles I got carried away,
How could I so rashly my ideals betray?
My mind always used to be so sharp and clear,
Yet a puppet in a play I’ve become, fake and insincere.
I should have avoided them, and left by them alone,
Like a star in the sky I’d shine, free and unknown.
Far away from earth I should have held my torch,  
Never deigning these arrogant men to approach…
For how long I shine, it is for Allah to decide,
He is the One, who sets a time for us to die. 
In misery I am buried, darkness fell upon me,
I am imprisoned here, day I will never see.
Hypocrites surround me, nowhere to hide or run,
I will never enjoy the moonlight or the rising sun. 
My lofty oaths and sacred work were empty promises,
Nobody sees Kaaba in absolute pitch darkness.
My soul cannot breathe – there is not enough air,
The suffocation of betrayal plunges me into despair.
No matter how hard it may be, put up a fight.
Once you give in, death will be your plight."
"Gabdulla Tukay   We Will Not Leave!","These people desperately want us all to leave:
“This land is wrong for you, under the Sultan live,”
We disagree, refusing to surrender to these lies,
For every ten spies here, there will be fifteen spies.
The Cossacks’ squads are merciless in clashes,
They wear fezs, too, and slash our backs with lashes.
We’ll never get from thieves and thugs a fair deal,
’Cause each of them is happy from a hungry man to steal.
So, thanks, but no thanks, we have no desire
To jump from the frying pan right into the fire.
When our towns pack up and leave, then we shall all agree
To leave this land for good, taking along our history.
Here we were born, and destined were to die,
With this country Tengri chose our people to tie.
We want to stay in Russia when the land is free.
You won’t make us leave, dark souls, this you’ll never see!
Leaving one’s home requires special courage:
Why won’t you go their first? Bon Voyage!"
"Gabdulla Tukay   I Feel Sick…","It is the crack of dawn, another senseless day about to start,
First sleep escaped me, nightmares then tore me all apart.
I’m all alone, whoever comes, he’s not the one I chose.
He sits right next to me, yet nothing makes us close.
What happened to my love for people and compassion?
Immersed in misery, meat and blood I see in my obsession.
My soul is frozen in life’s chilling frost,
Icy barriers surround me, here I am forever lost.
Isn’t a gorgeous girl just like a winter butterfly?
Instead of hiding in the warmth, she attempts to fly.
The earth feels sticky underfoot, I’m almost out of breath,  
Both sorrow and joy I see in the approach of death.
Life has lost its meaning – the fount has been exhausted 
In my soul. I see the end now, the abyss of death, instead.
There is no one to turn to, no place to go…
In Kaaba I see idols, on Islam’s body sits a crow.
Is it an Oblomov syndrome or, perhaps, a serious illness?
Let my skin dry out but spare my heart from emptiness.
 I am trying to patch up the beshmet of my soul,
Medication does not help, it only widens the hole.
When lonely, I used to sing, making it less tough,
Now my voice is hoarse, I cannot sing, I cough."
"Gabdulla Tukay   Admonition","If you see a beggar approaching your door,
Be merciful to him, his needs do not ignore.
You are no different – we are all great Allah’s slaves, 
This man begs for your mercy, a crust of bread he craves.
In this world he’s not the only who miserably fails,
Somebody gets the heads, and somebody the tails.
Power and wealth do not forever last,
Today you may be rich, tomorrow all is in the past.
To this bedraggled beggar be generous and kind,
Of Khyzar Ilyas his white beard should remind."
"Gabdulla Tukay   Tatar Youth","I am really proud of our Tatar youth.
I like the way they learn, discovering the truth.
Their thoughts are so inspiring, deep and bright,
Talented young people – what a joyful sight!
This generation came the deep seas to explore,
To make the clouds vanish and the rains to pour.
Their sacred dreams – they will revive our lands,
And stream down mountains to our luscious plains.
They will raise their swords for freedom, not plunder, 
The rumble of their fight will echo like thunder.
Our nation’s crown shines, it needs no sapphires, 
Youth is our precious gem that everyone admires."
"Gabdulla Tukay   Advice","My dear friend, please listen to my advice:
Conceal your secrets, or you’ll pay a price.
Your tears, grief and laughter you should hide. 
Your soul’s a treasure box, your greatest source of pride.
How cruel and spiteful is our callous human flock,
They love themselves, the rest they hate and mock.
They are like beasts, which you can never trust,
Even the fiercest wolf they have surpassed. 
You cannot keep your secrets, oh, how pitiful and sad,
The instant you have shared them, you are as good as dead.
You know how wolves go hunting for their prey,
Beware of evil — it will twist whatever you may say. 
If you are hurt, possessed by doubts or fears,
Cry softly when alone but always hide your tears,
And if they ask you why your eyes are wet,
Just tell them they are wet because of sweat."
"Gabdulla Tukay   Fame","Fame and glory is not why poetry you write,
Don’t hide your soul, leave it in full sight.
Stop complaining, humbly suffer through your pain.
There’s more to talent than prominence and fame."
"Gabdulla Tukay   It’s a holiday!","The world is joyful and merry today,
People have gathered for their holiday.
Everybody here is jubilant and gay,
A young man strums the saz – it’s a holiday!
The sun in the sky wears its festive attire,
For all folks the holiday to enjoy and admire.
There’s a faint whiff of magic in the air,
The world has been given perfume to wear.
A bedraggled beggar came up to a bai –
The rich man embraced him – it’s a holiday!
I went to the river, since I decided to stay,
Watch the waves splash and whisper: it’s a holiday!
Even the stubborn wind had something nice to say
In its light, gentle rustle – it’s a holiday!"
"Gabdulla Tukay   My Native Tongue","Oh, my native tongue, there is no other
Like the one spoken by my father and mother.
Whatever I have learned since when I was young
It is all thanks to you, my sweet native tongue.
My first words to utter I was not yet able,
Mother sang me lullabies, while rocking my cradle.
I’ll forever remember the tales from my granny —
She told me one each night, of them she knew so many.
If it weren’t for you, oh my beautiful tongue,
To this day I’d be speechless and hopelessly numb…
But you are so gracious, together did we grow,
You taught me to express my happiness and sorrow. 
Oh, my native tongue, how could I ever forget
That first prayer to Allah, which I myself read?
“Oh, Lord Almighty, in your mercy, please save
My poor parents and me – I’m your humble slave.”"
"Gabdulla Tukay   Autumn","Look around, my friends, autumn is here,
And winter in its white cloak is already near.
The birds are moving southward, flying far away, 
They have a better place where it is safe to stay.
The forest dyed in yellow, soon all its leaves are gone,
The harvesters have gathered their grain and corn.
Naked seem the fields, bald like a Tatar’s head,
The lark dives from the sky, hunting for his bread.
Small pockets of grass retain the gleam of silk,
The sun is getting tired – its rays are growing weak.
Darkness ousts the light. It makes me so sad.
The wind is cold and nasty, spins around my head.
Autumn is depressing, as everyone agrees,
Flowers lose their bloom, leafless stand the trees.
A forsaken graveyard is brighter than this field,
Without the summer grass, gone is its glossy shield.
Six months of heavy slumber… So I can shut my eyes,
Oblivious completely to those gloomy skies.
Nothing will awake me, neither heavy wind nor rain,
I will awaken only when spring comes back again.
The carpet of young grass will tempt me to lie down.
Happy I will be like the shah showing off his crown.
I wonder why my people aren’t happy in their land.
So let the day take over, and night come to an end.
Will I ever see this happen while I’m still alive?
Just a dream it is, alas, first I have to die."
"Gabdulla Tukay   To a Disgraced Tatar Girl","You stand alone, from your friends apart.
I feel your pain and moan, it breaks my heart.
Yellow like parchment is your grieving face,
With desperation filled and torment of disgrace.
Like a discarded puppy or a wounded bird.
I see your moving lips but don’t hear a word. 
Where’s the wealthy bastard you curse and wish to strangle?
We have aplenty villains — each one could kill an angel.
They have chosen to shaitan their souls to sell,
Why should it surprise us they’re not afraid of hell?
Yesterday I met the jerk, who caused you all this pain,
Selfish, vile and heartless, he’s doing it again.
Enjoying every minute of his barbaric spree,
While you suffer here, leaning against a tree. 
I wish you heard my words, believed that I’m your friend,
It is the poet’s mission to love and understand.
Though my heart is broken, my soul cries out in grief.
I wish my love and poetry could bring you some relief."
"Gabdulla Tukay   Two Suns","The earth lights up when the sun its journey starts.
When Sahibjamal appears on stage, she wins her people’s hearts.
The Creator has given these two such a magnificent glow,
While the Sun shines in the skies, the actress – in her show."
"Gabdulla Tukay   Bitter Plight","I wonder what would happen if I wasn’t born at all?
Poison seals my fate, forsakes my wretched soul.
My life goes by in circles, year after year,
I suffer through the winter, till summer’s heat gets near.
Why should my life be endless, where is my final rest?
Instead of one large step – I make three small, at best.
While looking at the sunrise, I see a bloody stain,
The murky shroud of early dawn is witnessing my pain.
If not for Allah’s anger I’d take my own empty life.
I’m destined to die of illness, not of a gun or knife."
"Gabdulla Tukay   Man in Love","When a lad is cheerful, joking all the time,
There should be something he intends to hide.
His love he is concealing, this miserable liar,
No smoke to see around, but he’s indeed on fire.
Cheerful and witty, he giggles, jokes and quips,
Then his beloved appears, and he quickly shuts his lips.
His cheeks are now ruby red. No matter how he tries
He cannot help but turn away his pleading, lovesick eyes.
He sees his charming guriah and cannot speak a word,
Numb and stunned like Moses who heard the voice of God.
Enough of that! Get serious, throw stupid jokes away.
A Muslim man has only Great Allah to obey.
The sounds of azan loudly remind us all to pray."
"Gabdulla Tukay    Lament","We all are so sinful, vile and spoiled inside.
Captured by corruption, in evil we abide.
Cherishing wrong values, not willing to repent,
We sell our souls for nothing, not even for a cent.
Filthy we become on this ungodly path,
Not only our bodies, – our souls need a bath."
"Gabdulla Tukay   I Will Not Sell Out","A sacred work for people was to you assigned.
But then a bunch of fiends entrapped your mind.
They said you must adjust to this imperfect age, 
Unless against its rules you plan a war to wage.
This transient world is stifling for whatever I begin,
But I refuse to bow, for my soul it would be a sin.
All my thoughts flow there, into boundless eternity
Ruled by perfect, glorious, everlasting beauty!
There I wish to shine and stay forever young,
When darkness falls on earth I will replace the sun.
And while in the sky I continue my jubilant walk,
All those on earth will set by me their watch or clock."
"Gabdulla Tukay   Evening Wish","The light in the flickering lamp is about to expire,
I have a burning ember in my breast, my thoughts are dire.
I better hurry up with my poem – the lamp is out of oil,
Not sure what I wrote makes sense… More paper I shall spoil
Scribbling line after line, ignoring commas and dots…
Later in the day I’ll sort my haphazard thoughts.
The dying flame is hopeless, it’s barely on,
I watch its final agony, it sighs, and then it’s gone.
What shall I do? It’s dark, but after lying down,
In my own gloomy thoughts I begin to drown. 
Tortured by insomnia, I suffer in the dark,
Till the lamp I address with this pitiful remark:
“Do not light up tomorrow, I beg you, lamp, and pray,
Until the Judgment Day in bed I wish to stay!”"
"Gabdulla Tukay   Recollections","Life in paradise – that’s what Iblis recalls when he is tired,
I am tired of myself, I wish I was again a child.
Those days my soul, like water in the creek, was fresh and clear, 
Green as the shoots of grass, which in the spring appear. 
There is no place for sorrow; life’s beauty beckons you,
The earth sprinkled with diamonds, the sky is turquoise blue,
Life without sadness, happy, joyous, and just,
Your entire self you can to nature trust.
Admire trees and flowers, watch how they grow,
Listen to the gentle voice of a chirping swallow.
Your soul thrives on beauty – innocent and pure,
Love flowing through it for the sun and all of nature
With never-ending kindness your soul is overfilled,
As if a bridge between the sky and earth is being built.
If you share your bread with those who are in need,
Proud you are of being generous, defeating greed.
Adults will read you a book from time to time,
It might even be poetry, with its melody and rhyme.
Listening, however, makes you drowsy. Hard as you try
To stay awake, your eyes are shut, and they refuse to lie. 
Your dreams are rosy; sleep is quiet and sound,
But when you wake at dawn the sun is not yet round. 
Tahir and Zuhra’s story suddenly makes you cry,
As you think of these two lovers who destined were to die."
"Gabdulla Tukay   The Critic","I wrote a myriad verses, some are good, I’m told.
Yet, my critics always find plenty in them to scold.
For each of us these folks will find a scathing word.
I have a friend: his words are sharper than a sword.
He sees a windmill and “No water!” he will scream,
While looking a watermill he claims it has no steam.
He grabs a horse by the tail: “Oh, what nice long hair,
But why won’t it grow on its head instead. I think it is unfair.”
“The plowman ruins the earth,” he will insist.
“You, writers, from critiquing them should not desist.”
What could be wrong with a sheep’s belly, yet he is on his toes:
“For Russian vets,” he will lament, “these Tatars are real foes.”"
"Gabdulla Tukay   Comments on Love","Opinions vary on what real love is worth,
Great Heine thought it was a star that fell on earth.
Yes, on earth, but in manure, in dirt it fell, 
Wrapping up the universe in slops and toxic smell 
The pig is honking in that yard, and cackle says the cock,
O, poor star of love, they know how one to mock!
Yet in this dreadful place the star sees pleasant dreams,
Flowers blossom there all year in happier realms."
"Gabdulla Tukay   Kazan and Beyond","The city of Kazan up on a hill is radiant like a torch,
Tall as a candle is each mosque, minaret, and church.
Kazan, your light shines forth for other towns so bright,
Showing all and sundry, which way for them is right.
Tetyushi and Spas, Chary and Chistopol,
They are so dear to me I’d like to name them all.
Kazan, look round at these towns and villages,
While sharing light with them, you linger in dark ages.
The spot beneath a lamp or candle has no light,
God, I hate this wisdom ’cause it’s damn so right."
"Gabdulla Tukay   Not Funny","Some things may sound quite funny in a poem of mine,
And yet it speaks of suffering, of our curse’s sign.
The tortures of my soul, indeed, they make me laugh,
How long am I doomed to suffer, as though I hadn’t enough?
My grief is like a snake with such deceptive shiny skin.
Deep fear mixed with happiness; instead of a smile – a grin.
Oh no, I am in sorrow through my days, I swear.
You’re staring at my shoes? Galoshes I choose to wear."
"Gabdulla Tukay   Hopelessness","My soul, leave my body and go back to the skies,
The era of spirit is gone, we live in dark times.
I beg of you, do not accept this vile world again,
O, Sun don’t rise, hide, turn into a muddy stain.
Flowers, cease to grow, forget the dream of spring!
To ashes you will turn, when earth stops breathing, 
Friendship and pure love today are little worth,
Shirin and Farhad, just know, hell is become of earth.
Stop thinking all the time, you, great men and sages.
Let tyranny be cursed, and left to former ages.
Vanish should every dangerous disease,
Tyranny, the worst of them, you never should appease.
Stop raising hands to Allah, all you, who were turned away,
You will get back your rights on the Judgment day. 
Stop joking and laughing, you should not sing or dance,
Listen to earth moaning – all fun should stop at once.
O, how wrong for truth is our century,
These days have no place for real poetry."
"Gabdulla Tukay   Without Title","A poet has to know what songs he sings,
His nation has a soul, and he must touch its strings.
Life is hard, so his rhymes are filled with sadness,
Forget your stupid jokes and joyful madness.
Long, dark and piteous is the road,
People break their backs with life’s heavy load.
In their souls many hide their grief,
Buried so deep inside, there is no relief.
Poor creatures, with sorrow they can’t unveil, 
Too bad, joy and laughter won’t in their life prevail. 
Blessed are only those who treat themselves to booze,
This venom of oblivion for themselves they choose.
After getting drunk they start this world to praise,
Elevate their egos in a drunken haze."
"Gabdulla Tukay    A Holiday in Childhood","Childhood in his memory a poet keeps,
Everyone has a dream, both bitter and sweet.
Holiday comes, I wish I were a child, to laugh and play,
The eve of Garafa saw sadness swept away.
I recall how impatiently I waited for the dawn,
Eager new ichigs, my new shirt and pants to put on.
Sweet were my dreams before night left my doorway,
In my dreams so bright was this upcoming holiday.
I’ll always remember my Mother’s gentle voice:
“Gaid Namaz is here, get up and let’s rejoice!”
Running like crazy along the crowded streets,
Who was happier than me? It was pure joy and bliss.
And right after the prayer, I would blithely laugh.
O, the yummy taste of Qurbani meat – never enough.
In my memory engrained, I can’t hold back tears,
How joyful was this time, those unforgettable years.
Rays of light from the sky streaming down upon you…
Not just one sun was shining, but at least two. 
O, Great Allah, I beg of you and pray.
Let me go back, and in my childhood stay,
Rejoice in cheerful laughter and endless merry play."
"Gabdulla Tukay    Potatoes and Enlightenment","From America, potato, you’ve made your journey here,
Enlightenment arrived from Europe, which is near.
O, potato, at first you looked so odd and weird,
People were prejudiced to you and thought you a ‘jadid’:*
“Sinners brought it here, who refuse by God to abide.
Can’t you understand? Potato’s poisonous inside!”
Poor little thing, whether a vegetable or fruit,
People despised you, pulling out every root. 
“Whoever eats the nasty thing will be punished,”
“Evil apple” they called you and urged you banished. 
Good for you, potato, these wicked times are gone,
Comfort in the belly of a Tatar you have won! 
You know, a Tatar burps and says how Allah’s great.
The Tatar praises the Lord, after emptying the plate.
Enlightenment, this pattern you should follow:
Just give our men the wisdom fruit to swallow."
"Gabdulla Tukay   Sick in the Country","Winter, I pine in the village, hopelessly ill,
In summer, peasants labored so hard, now all is still.
I feel lazy too, taking a break with other men,
Hoping come spring to be healthy again.
My poems mirror gloomy winter thoughts,
At times I think of bread, potatoes cooked in pots.
Potato, come to me, you’re my favorite for sure.
The wealthy love your taste as do the poor.
You traveled from America to suffer with us here,
Sad is our people’s fate, its ignorance austere."
"Gabdulla Tukay   To Genius","On this world you witnessed darkness fall,
You had to find a spark, some lofty goal. 
Determined to succeed, no thought you had of rest, 
Marching courageously, passing every test.  
What happened to you then, it is not clear,
You suddenly looked back, when already near.
The blaze you saw came not from light but gold,
Neither life it had nor warmth, nothing but cold.
Of all temptations this is probably the worst,
Seduced were many others, you were not the first.
Never look back, my genius, only ahead,
A straight path awaits those by Allah led."
"Gabdulla Tukay   Immorality","We have no respect for morale or decency,
Hopeless we are, our souls are so shady.
No better than a thief who hunts his prey,
We’ve become cautious with everything we say.
If one is bright but poor, we won’t say a word,
Eloquence we bequeath as the rich man’s reward."
"Gabdulla Tukay   Betrayed","I had enough of mockery to crack my heart,
We were together but now it is time to part.
Not to the Quran’s ayats you chose to adhere,
You deceived me with sweet nothings, now it is clear.
My passion is worth more than empty words, fake tears,
Who but myself to blame for the many wasted years?
With a phantom obsessed, I was chasing the wind!
Your beautiful blue eyes were always on my mind,
You were so close to me, an illusion in the sky,
That bleeding heart of mine is tired, let me die.
I can see the smiles of my gloating foes,
They knew all along how hopeless it was.
My life a living hell, I shed tears day and night,
Holding on to hope, when I had lost the fight.
For all my fruitless efforts I had a better use,
Serving my beloved nation – that’s what I had to choose.
If I were not bewitched, I’d chose the rightful way,
And my people would honor me till the Judgment day.
What did you do to make me trust all those lies?
I failed to see your true self under the fake disguise.
I have devoted to you my noble poetic soul,
What did you give me in return, your beauty ever cold?
Goodbye my love, from now on you enchant me no more,
Find another man, perhaps him you’ll truly adore."
"Gabdulla Tukay   The Prophet","When Allah chose me as a prophet who will teach
His word, I took it as a bond that I’ll never breach.
I am his humble servant, time has come to preach
Eternal truths, good equally for poor and rich. 
Whether a pauper or a padishah, we’re all the same: 
Each one of us is sinful, we must take the blame.
I called for them to love their neighbor so deep 
I could not eat, I could not drink, I could not fall asleep. 
But if they only had a chance to stone me to death,
They eagerly would do it, until my final breath. 
Because of my ayats, I victim fell to lies,
To hatred, mockery. But their rejection I despise.
It’s pointless to whine, it’s useless to complain.
You never question, why has Allah caused this pain?
I looked like a beggar, shabby, hungry and tired –
My only hope was to run, so I could peace acquire.
Here in the desert, all by myself, alone 
I pray, and praise, and glorify the throne.
Here I see the worlds that I’ve already passed,
Of the good and evil of the past, I know the good will last.
I see the nations that are gone — samouds and gads. 
I see the bottom of the sea with fish in myriads.
Here I comfort and tame the cruel hungry beasts
They sheepishly give up on their bloody feasts.  
The lions and the panthers all had to be sworn,
They’ll never eat a prophet, we won’t have to mourn. 
But when I enter a big city full of noise,
Then all the people suddenly rejoice. 
Angry sages can be heard, saying to the youth:
“Look at this crazy man, who claims to know truth!
He is a nobody, yet he wants to satisfy his pride,
He’s challenging the laws we all have to abide. 
Sons, learn your lesson from this loser’s plight.
He’s an outcast, he has lost his hopeless fight. 
Cursed be this lunatic, who wants us to believe
That he is wise enough to teach us how to live. 
How dare he think that he can preach in Allah’s name?
We won’t let this happen, he will die in shame!"
"Gabdulla Tukay   Eulogy","…You’ve finally departed, kitty cat…
Farewell, my lovely purry pet!
Honored as a saint upon demise,
You were so merciless to mice…"
"Gabdulla Tukay   Truth and Lies","There was nothing but water ages ago.
Truth and Lies swam together — two bitter foes.
Almighty Tengri sent them just one boat, 
But they were eager to cut each other’s throat.
It didn’t take long before they started to bicker, 
With such animosity, it could happen even quicker.
Lies struck the first, with the strength of a mighty hand.
And Truth vanished forever, never reaching land."
"Gabdulla Tukay   Your Hand","Your hand makes happy me, I’m your slave,
Your magic touch is a caressing wave,
It shines like gold fish in a summer pond.
An angel’s hand and yours in a friendly bond,
My wounded soul it will help to cure.
Whatever I am to face you help me to endure.
I’m entrapped in your hand, I’m in love.
So strong is your grasp, I cannot move.
The dawn of true happiness you let me see,
And this feeling is greater and deeper than the sea.
At the touch of your gentle and wonderful hand,
I ascend to the sky, with no beginning or end.
Slender and graceful like a silver birch,
You inspire my poetry, you’re my torch.
Please forgive me the fantasy world of my verse,
No, your hand isn’t so perfect, of course.
And yet, I worship your wonderful palm
That makes me feel so humble and numb."
"Gabdulla Tukay    The Dance","Young couples dancing through the night,
The orchestra plays loudly, what a delight!
Women are offering candies for sale,
Candy wraps glisten like a fairytale.
Such merriment and joy, onlookers say,
See how the crowd is carried away?
Guess who stole the show? – A goat and a lamb!
Kicking their hooves up high – bam, bam."
"Gabdulla Tukay   A Girl with Ugly Teeth","“I am constantly surrounded by guys.
Each of them is trying to be nice…”
Poor thing, she was completely at a loss,
She had no clue how these lads to toss.
No question, they were flattering her pride,
Luckily, there was a way to get this knot untied:
“Getting rid of them is easy — simply laugh,
They will run from you, your smile is grim enough.”"
"Gabdulla Tukay    Some People Like…","Someone likes winter, but the freezing cold
Makes poor people shiver, both young and old.
And others like summer, its beauty and grace…
But what about those who don’t have a place
To hide from the heat – for them it is hell,
They dream of a shelter where to dwell.
Admire this world with its rivers and seas,
Then why do I dislike it the way it is?
We, sons of Adam, are this world’s disease."
"Gabdulla Tukay   If Not For…","So cold’s the finest art without a flaming heart.
The rose in bloom is pale without a nightingale.
The poet extols your image in disguise,
You trust the mirror – your reflection lies. 
There are so many pretty girls under the moon,
Who would’ve heard of Leila if not for her Mejnun. 
Such beauty ought to be in poetry engraved
Lucky is the poet by your charm enslaved."
"Gabdulla Tukay    To… («He met you somewhere on his way…»)","He met you somewhere on his way,
The joyful lad got carried away:
“Quran praises you as the best of the best? 
There’s no one like you in the East or West.”
Amazed that the Holy Book has been mentioning her,
He purchased the Quran in the Sabach bookstore."
"Gabdulla Tukay   Impression","When I’ve these downfalls in life, 
When my pain is sharper than a knife,
I begin to read the magic surahs of Quran.
They send my grief and sorrow on the run.
All doubt leaves my heart and I cry,
Tears are clear, as pearls, almost dry.
I’m a Muslim, the Iman relieves my soul,
Burdens, go away, I have a clear goal.
Allah, I accept the things you wish to bar.
“Allah’s great!” – I shout. – “Allah akbar!”"
"Gabdulla Tukay   A Chat","At times, I sit in front of her, admiring her eyes,
Her pupils dark, her eyebrows black, the beautiful disguise. 
I don’t know where she’s coming from; she knows not what I mean,
Yet hours pass by, she still recounts what she has heard and seen.
Still as a sphinx, my eyes on her, I echo every word,
And so she thinks I am in love, enthralled with what I’ve heard.
In fact, I cannot understand a single word I hear.
What is the sense? Why even try? It’s pointless, I fear.
If she perceives that I pretend she’ll fly into a rage.
But ’tis the truth, I cannot lie, her fears I can’t assuage.
I hate it when she carries on, obsessed with empty matters.
Why can’t she say, “I love you so!” Instead, she sits and chatters.
She is prattling at me, always happy to share…
I gladly respond but continue to stare
At her, so she’s sure I’m in love.
That might be the reason why I can’t move. 
I am all attention. My pose is so tense,
I hear every word but can’t make any sense."
"Gabdulla Tukay   To My People","You occupy my thoughts both day and night
Your health is mine; your plight, it is my plight
Oh people mine, you sacred above all
You I cannot betray for all the world
With boundless joy to you I will belong
To you I’ll consecrate my poet’s song
I don’t know why these words should ring so true
I yearn to be the people’s poet, borne of you
The nation’s dream above all dreams must soar
In my own mind, it maddens and it roars
Oh Tengri, I will be her poet… loyal, whole
That is the greatest aspiration of my soul
Oh heavens, take my soul, not my renown
To be forgotten? Better yet to drown.
For I can die, but death won’t take my name
My deeds and efforts should enjoy eternal fame
To be remembered by my people is my goal
I’ve written of my love, befriend me in your soul!"
"Gabdulla Tukay   Love Is Strange","It is a summer day, it is extremely hot.
A man is sweating, so he takes a pot,
Fills it with water, ready to cool off.
He suddenly begins to tremble and to cough. 
Already naked, he starts having doubts
Apparently with some of his old freak-outs.
He takes the pot with water and then puts it back.
Then takes it again… He thinks he’s on track.
It’s hot outside but the water is cold,
So he is ready to put his bath on hold.
But he has to prove he is brave enough,
He stops for a second to tremble and cough.
So he spills all the water over his head,
And that makes him happy and awfully glad:
“How clever I am, I am always on top,
I didn’t get wet, not even a drop.”  
I hope, you got the irony of this verse,
The story I told, is a joke, of course.
But it is like my love, which has driven me insane
I run like Shurale – will I see her again?
I’m hiding my eyes when I see her by chance.
She thinks I am calm, I get nervous at once.
I constantly live with this passionate flame,
I write all my verses without my name.
Why should I continue to behave like a fool?
And yet when I see her I’m distant and cool.
My heart is on fire, I’m burning alive.
If only she leaves – I’ll maybe survive.
Finally I’m told she’s moved back home,
No verses to write, my thoughts can roam.
Who wrote them all, she can only guess
She’ll never learn the truth I have to confess.
My poetry is good to be a rug under her feet,
She is welcome to stand on it, to lie down, or sit.
If she wished to leave this place, so let it be,
I will keep the secret of my poetry with me."
"Gabdulla Tukay    To Pushkin","Pushkin Alexander, please accept my admiration,
I am a poet too, from thee I get my inspiration.
O wizard of the verse! Thou make the stones dance,
To be a poet without harmony or music – not a chance!
I am enchanted by the magic strength of perfect rhyme,
God chose Alexander to be the genius of his time.
The Solar light and warmth defeat dark night and cold,
The world is blessed to shine under the Sun of Gold.
I dared to invade the orchard, where the tree
Of Pushkin bears its fruit. I tasted it… Delicious poetry!
I wandered in thy orchard, full of singing birds.
I flew along with them – I sang but in my own words.
Thy lyre is like a creek, it touches every nerve,
That’s why the monuments to you – you fully them deserve.  
I never claim to understand thy credo and beliefs.
The only dream I have it is to learn from thy motifs. 
O God Almighty, is it possible at all? 
Bestow on me the talent that will match my call."
"Gabdulla Tukay   Hope","My sleepy consciousness, you had enough of dreams,
You, clouds, go away, chased out by the sunbeams.
Blind and confused, I’m desperate and tired,
O, pull me out of darkness – where’s my guide?
I’m so deep in the abyss, throw me a thread,
Which I can hold on to, otherwise I’m dead.
You’ve inspired me, the brightest torch of truth!
Without the light you shed, the sun’s no use.
Reveal your glory; coming are the days
When darkness falls and light forever stays.
Instead of bread I swallow only stones,
My legs are weak and fragile are my bones.
I tried to catch a bird, instead I got a frog,
It’s hard to see, I’m helpless in the fog.
I befriend an evil foe while punishing my peer.
I don’t have a heart so I pierce him with a spear.
I’m waiting for the light that’ll show me the way,
Don’t go down, sun, please shine another day.
My consciousness lies dormant, it’ll wake up again,
The noble soul of mine I promise to regain.
On the ground the eagle fell but he is born to reign."
"Gabdulla Tukay   The Field in Winter","The field is covered with a blanket of snow,
The earth is asleep, spring postpones her show.
All nature will sleep yet another cold month,
Waiting till winter surrenders to warmth.
Green grass under ice will be released,
Birds will be coming back from the East.
Sunny and shiny come April and May,
Night is getting shorter, longer stays the day.
Birds will be chirping in the woods again, 
Thunder will roar loudly, followed by rain.
Sun will be greeted every day anew, 
On the grass night will leave cold droplets of dew. 
Sleep, earth, stay warm, remain patient and calm,
This happy spring time has yet to come. 
Sweet be your dreams, keep your blanket on,
Smiling, you’ll wake up when winter is gone."
"Gabdulla Tukay   The Crescent and the Sun","There is a golden cradle in the Himalayan heights,
The one who sleeps in it is guarded through the night.
When the Sun is rising, the Wind is already there
Praising the Sun’s entrance, the world must be aware.
The Wind serves as a herald whose duty is to say:
“The Sun’s already up, greet another day!”
And when the Sun is out, performing his daily race,
Crescent, his young brother, takes the cradle’s space.
Never left alone, he’s surrounded by the stars,
Like the tiniest of torches, they shine from afar.
Crescent in the cradle sleeps for the entire night,
Till the Sun awakens Him with early morning light.
Day comes after night, brother comes after brother,
While one of them rests, he can count on the other."
"Gabdulla Tukay   My Village","Up on the hill, is my village, my aul,
There is a creek, with water pure and cool.
I feel its taste, I know its every part,
I love this place with all my soul and heart.
Here, praised be Allah, I was born and raised
And with the Holy Book, Quran’s ayats amazed.
Here I was told about Muhammad’s life,
Our great prophet, who had taught us to survive.
When I remember that, my eyes fill up with tears
In memory forever live these childhood years.
How with my brother in the field we used to plow
And grains of wheat and rye in soil sow.
I’m still a stranger to this world, but who is not?
I still have much to learn, to see a lot.
And yet I know but one most sacred rule
In memory to keep my village, my aul."
"Gabdulla Tukay   Kitap","In those moments when my spirit is low,
I hate myself, I feel nothing but sorrow.
With pangs of remorse I look for a place,
Where I could peace and comfort embrace.
I’m in a total void, miserable and sad,
Dark thoughts race spinning through my head. 
My eyes have barely dried of tears,
A still darker image before me appears.
In moments like these I turn to the Scripture
What I find on its pages my mind can picture.
And suddenly joy fills my poor exhausted soul,
Chasing away dark thoughts and making troubles go.
Every page I read, every line and every verse,
Turn to shining stars, showing me the course.
O, how meaningless become all these earthly concerns,
My eyes are opened and the light returns.
Now I’m forgiven, I am redeemed and safe,
That’s what the Holy Book means for Allah’s slave.
It brings back confidence, self esteem and trust,
With hope I view the future, leaving behind the past."
"Gabdulla Tukay   To a Child","Shurales and genies – there is nothing to fear,
They are not for real, they’ll never appear.
In old times people believed in shurales,
But we know now those were just folk tales.
For imaginary ghosts there aren’t any meadows,
Shurale likes forests to hide in the shadows.
In the meantime have patience, and study for now,
Learning will help you all this to know."
"Gabdulla Tukay   Birds","Foolish birds, let me staunch your fear,
No need to panic while I’m standing near.
I enjoy the language of these birds,
Lord has made them sing without words.
Sing your tunes, don’t fly away or run,
I join you unarmed, I’ve no snare or gun.
In peace I come, without squabble or strife,
I pose no danger to freedom in your life.
Man can be a friend, if you’ll just believe,
After listening quietly, I promise you to leave."
"Gabdulla Tukay    To Guria (Heavenly Nymph)","In heaven, if I chance upon your face
In it, I’ll see my own reflection’s trace.
I know that you beguile and charm,
Entrance, envelop, and disarm.
Your beauty is the heavens’ art
Celestial grace in every part.
I love you, love you without shame,
My love a constant, lapping flame.
I will forget worldly delights,
Your proud bearing in my sights.
Your every word a healing balm,
My soul awakens in your palm.
Your body dwarfs celestial spheres,
Your tongue a prayer for all ears.
No nightingale can match your voice,
Oh, who could part with you by choice?
You, who are holy and revered,
Mere mortals dare not touch you here.
Your beauty peerless and divine,
Among so many, still you shine,
An emerald, a precious stone . . .
But not the same as our own.
Of praises you shall have your fill
But earthly girls are dearer still."
"Gabdulla Tukay   Get Rid of Gold!","Allah, God Almighty, let gold be cursed,
Of all the earthly evils this one is the worst.
Call for your archangels, whom you have to tell
That this yellow metal belongs in hell.
All the yellow shaitans should in fire burn,
This revenge poor people have surely earned.
Save this world of ours from shaitan and Iblis,
Life without gold will be our blessing and bliss.
Gold is pure evil, tempting people’s lust,
Those who worship gold keep the devil’s trust.
Much as I have traveled, been to many lands,
This world is ruled by gold, gold beckons and commands.
Truth is overshadowed by the golden calf,
Who will fight the devil – who will say ‘enough’?
Torah, Quran, Bible – the Word of God is told.
Yet people, deaf and blind, still believe in gold."
"Gabdulla Tukay   From Byron","A year from now, you’ll chance upon this verse,
You’ll see, perhaps, this sad song run its course
And ponder how the poet must have yearned
To give his heart for you, he must have burned.
Though strange a little, he could sing a song,   
This tragic figure with his love so strong;  
You’ll think, he is no more; he’s played his part
Beneath his verse, he buried his whole heart."
"Gabdulla Tukay   The Swallow","A swallow by my window is building a nest,
Carrying branches for it, not knowing rest.
She endlessly brings twigs of wood and clay,
Putting love and hard work in it day after day.
So her house now looks quite solid and good,
Everything’s ready for her wondrous brood.
Hushing her babies with sweet lullabies,
To feed them, she catches mosquitoes and flies,
She works all day long, and only in the night
She covers her head with her wings and sleeps tight.
Nothing awakens her, neither thunder nor wind,
She sleeps with the little ones on her mind.
What people are doing she could not care less,
The swallow’s enveloped in her happiness."
"Gabdulla Tukay   To Your Portrait","I look and worship these dark brows and eyes,
Praised be the artist who drew her so nice.
He ordered the sun to pour gold on her hair,
No other beauty to her can compare.
Forgive me, dear sun, for your rays are too weak,
You pale in the shadow of her gorgeous cheek.
If Mejnun was here and saw her by chance,
The love for his Leila would vanish at once.
In the Garden of Eden, I strongly believe,
Adam would surely prefer her to Eve.
Harut and Marut were both tempted by devil,
This angel could help them to struggle with evil.
The taste of her lips is as sweet as sorbet,
And those who shall try them, immortal will stay.
When Iblis, the devil, was rejected and expelled,
Just one glance at her, and he’d regret he rebelled.
So, sing her hosanna, oh birds of the earth,
Or die by the knife, you’ve disproven your worth."
"Gabdulla Tukay   Evening in Winter","I like to watch the kids on winter nights at home,
The house is warm, they’re sitting by the stove.
The kids are joyful, one next to the other,
And nothing makes them sad and nothing seems to bother.
While listening to fairy tales, the night is not so long,
They do not hear the wind, howling and strong,
It’s angry, trying to tear down the wall.
The birds are all a’tremble, large and small.
Kids, feel lucky, you’re warm and fed,
Think of all those without home or bread.
No one to feed these poor orphans, no place to go,
Just this windy night with no tomorrow.
Frost is biting at their noses and ears,
Little icicles have grown from their tears.
Kids, remember all those poor and needy,
Think of them, don’t be selfish, heartless, greedy."
"Gabdulla Tukay   My Will","My soul, you finally rested, so answer my call.
Allah awaits you once and for all.
Time has come to look death in the eyes.
Just one last request to all my friends:
“Let mullahs read my verses when my life’s path ends,
Let those who cry infidel, shamefully run.
I am full of belief in the Holy Quran!”"
"Gabdulla Tukay   In Allah You Should Trust","My innocent child, you’re sinless, and just,
Allah, the Lord, is the One you should trust.
No one is as merciful, as our Lord,
He will light up your path in this world.
He is so generous, forgiving and kind.
Your soul is sinless, and sinless stays your mind.
The words you pronounce never hurt anybody.
Your soul is stainless, and so is your body.
My little angel, so innocent and pure,
Prayer to Allah is your remedy and cure.
Strengthen your faith in Allah the Lord,
Nobody is kinder than Him in the world."
"Gabdulla Tukay   Poet","Time will pass, I will age and grow old,
Hunched, enfeebled and nearly bald.
But my soul will stay young, it will never surrender
While I nurture the flames of passion and anger.
They give me strength to lift the heavy rock.
The day is young and through the spring I walk.
A poet knows no winter and no cold.
Let my body age, but not my soul.
I refuse to sit and mumble, and lament,
Allah give me strength, I do not want to bend.
I’ll heat the whole house with my rhymes,
And I’ll be singing when my hour arrives.
Asrail, he cannot silence me.
Yes, I am leaving but you all will be.
I’ll remain a poet ’till I feel death’s blow,
And Allah summons me into the earth below."
"Gabdulla Tukay   A Mother’s Prayer","The effervescent moon over the village rises. Night.
Painting the houses silver, bathing fields in light.
The people sleep. You cannot hear a peep.
They worked from dawn to dusk; their sleep is sweet and deep.
The dogs don’t bark; there is no sound, as if the village died.
Yet on the edge, there is one house whose window casts a light.
And in that house, after her evening prayer
An older woman sits; her thoughts so far from there,
Her arms raised up in prayer, she asks about her son:
“Oh Allah, make his life a happy one!”
And as she speaks, her cheeks are bathed in tears.
How can such prayers not reach the Creator’s ears?"
"Gabdulla Tukay   When Moscow Reins You in","Haji, your hardships will begin,
When Moscow starts to rein you in.
When they start getting hard on you,
What are you going to do?
You thought of yourself as rich and tough,
Whatever you had it was never enough.
You’ll soon be confined to your cell in jail,
When Moscow picks you out to nail.
You mocked the theater everyone adores,
Spending time with thugs and filthy whores.
“Gotcha,” people now will triumphantly say,
Moscow will deal with you the hard way.
The pious mullahs will run from you away,
They are the first ones a friend to betray.
No doubt, it will happen to you too,
When Moscow comes after you.
What about all your devoted friends?
Soon as they see you caught, their friendship ends.
Young people you would shamelessly turn in,
Same will happen to you when Moscow brings you in.
The infidels and you still live in paradise,
But it’s about to change, you will pay a price.
Time will come to answer for each and every sin,
Better be prepared when Moscow calls you in.
I am deeply worried about your sorry fate,
Listen to my words before it is too late. 
As a friend I warn you, believe me this is true, 
You will see it happen when Moscow comes after you.
You had wed four women, you were enjoying life,
Now you’d be happy with one and only wife.
For your thoughtless deeds there is a heavy toll,
Which Moscow will prove when it takes you under control…"
"Gabdulla Tukay   A Mouse That Fell in a Bowl of Milk…","(from an American newspaper)
I don’t know how or why, but this I’m told,
A little caged mouse fell in a bowl
Of milk, swam back and forth, could not escape,
The milk was liquid, drowning was her fate.
All frantic motion, where will she be safe?
She’s paddling here and there, she keeps her faith.
Her work was not in vain, I’m pleased to utter,
She swam so long, that milk turned into butter
And for a moment you could see her standing there.
Then, she leapt off and ran into her lair.
My dearest one! If you are treading that same bowl,
Be patient, stoic, don’t forget your goal.
With lips of honey you I praise for high moral,
But when I’m faced with evil, I will quarrel.
In my directness, meanness takes her stage,
It is enough to make me fly into a rage.
“Why so?  You’re not allowed,” I yell. “You’re busted.”
“Oh, fools, just go to hell.”  I am disgusted.
And if they aim at me with nonsense, I don’t say
That they are wrong, and that is not the way…
“You are mistaken in your aim, friend, take your arrow,”
I say all friendly, though it pierced me to the marrow.
My heart is bitter, bitter turns my rhyme.
It’s undercooked, although I thought that it was time.
I want to free a songbird from my chest,
Instead, a cat meows there, oh what a pest!
A rainbow holds its color for all hours,
Each taste will find its match in sweet and sour.
I also mix the sweet and bitter in my deed,
Following Lermontov and Pushkin as my creed.
Slowly but surely I climb ever higher,
I want to cry out from the quivering spire.
From such great heights, I am afraid to fall
But I will brave the way, I’ll reach my goal.
My dormant feelings finally will awake.
No grave needs to correct me, I am no mistake,
And in my heart, Tengri will light the path,
Watch after me with patience, not with wrath."
"Gabdulla Tukay   A Tale about a Goat and a Sheep","Once there lived a man together with his wife.
So often were they troubled by the life.
Perhaps it was because they had a goat and a sheep,
Which were so thin and even couldn’t leap.
 
«Wife, listen», said the man one day,
 «You know how short we are of hay. 
I’d like the goat and the sheep the real life to taste.
For what they eat is just a waste».
Without arguing the wife said to the man: 
«Let them together leave us, that’s your plan. 
Of course, my husband, right words you’ve said. 
What’s use in them? They’ve never even bred».
The goat and the sheep were at a loss,
But they obeyed; the man was their boss.
So in a grief like this they took a bag
And made the way through fields along the crag.
In silence walked they rather long.
The world for them was like a mournful song,
And only God knew why them he led
To see so suddenly a dead wolfs head.
The goat full of fear wouldn’t touch the head, 
The sheep was also scared, almost dead. 
Thus, stood they both close to the head, 
«You are to touch it», they to each other said.
The goat said, «Oh dear sheep, so strong you are!»
The sheep replied, «But bravery of mine from yours is so far»
Thus, two companions, having chicken hearts,
Were too afraid to take it in the hands.
At last they took a hold of that big head 
And seizing by the ears to their bag they fled. 
Soon the monstrous head was in the bag, so deep. 
What a relief they felt, the goat and the sheep.
So further walked and walked our two friends.
The road seemed for them to have no end.
But soon they saw a fire in the dark.
«Let’s there spend the night», the goat’s was remark
«Bad wolves are certain not to come to it. 
We shall be safe, the place is so lit». 
The goat wisdom saw in this advice. 
And hoped it wouldn’t turn to have a vice.
Close came they up to this bright light. 
What a nightmare saw they in the night. 
Four wolves were sitting close to it 
And boiling water for some meat.
The goat and the sheep when saw this sight, 
The hearts of theirs sank; they got a lot of fright. 
«Oh, wolves, my friends, you are all here!» 
The goat said not to betray her fear.
How happy were the wolves when them they saw;
 «The meat has come itself, we don’t wish more. 
We shall be quick to catch them both. 
The meal will be the best, we take an oath».
The goat said, «Don’t think too much about meat. 
We have a lot of it in our bag, so neat. 
Don’t waste your time, oh sheep my dear friend, 
We have a nice wolfs head for them to lend».
The sheep was quick to take it out of the bag
And showed it to the wolves without any lag.
So using moments when the wolves received this smash,
The goat went on cutting this enormous dash.
The goat said «How stupid one can be?
This tiny one offends my friends and me. 
We have twelve heads, so take a bigger one, 
You should respect my friends, it isn’t fun».
The sheep, thanks to our God, caught this trick
To take the same head out of the bag she was so quick,
And when in front of them another head was laid.
Oh, poor wolves! Believe me. They were so much afraid.
The wolves forgot the thought of eating. 
They only thought of rapid leaving. 
And having made the minds to run away, 
They waited for a chance to be on their way.
The eldest wolf soon rose and then he said: 
«l guess for our meal we’ll need some bread. 
I’ll go to the village to look for some, 
My friends, I promise quickly back to come».
Thus their chief went to the village for some bread. 
Time passed, but their waiting seemed to have no end. 
Of course, the eldest one was wise enough to flee. 
And this result was definitely to foresee.
The wolves got frightened even more, 
For their chief was one who knew the law 
Of being fast and swift to run from danger, 
Especially if you met an awful stranger.
The eldest one was followed by another soon, 
Who in his turn home went to take a spoon. 
Again in vain they waited for some time, 
But leaving friends for them was not a crime.
The other two were also soon away, 
They didn’t want to take part in the fray. 
The goat and the sheep soon felt a relief. 
It was the God who helped them and belief.
The fire soon warmed up two our friends, 
They even cooked a meal from odds and ends. 
And having eaten, they rested for a while, 
The night was spent on such a soft big pile.
The goat and the sheep woke up at dawn, 
They took the bag which saved them from that mourn 
Again they made the way through fields and woods, 
But as for us, let’s part with them for goods."
"Gabdulla Tukay    The Water Maid","(Told by a country boy)
I
Тhe summer day was hot and sunny, and I was swimming in the lake; 
A splash of water, games so funny and dives I liked to take.
This merry way I did enjoy my playing for an hour
And certain was I not to sweat, moreover short I was of power;
So quickly I ran out of the lake to put my clothes on.
But what was wrong? A sence of fear! And all my friends were gone!
To leave the place I was about, but suddenly I saw a bridge.
And on the bridge I saw an awful woman. Was she a mermaid or a witch?
In the daylight, broad and clear, golden combs of hers I saw. 
She was doing her long hair, I had doubts no more.
 
Breathless, frightened even shocked stood 1 there not so long; 
In the shade of old thick trees I felt tremor in my knees.
Having combed her thick long hair, splashing water in the air 
In the waves she dissapeared. Oh, my Lord, I so feared.
As for me I ran towards the bridge, thoughtless was of course that siege. 
But how great was my surprise: golden combs of hers beheld my eyes.
What I did — I looked around. Not a single soul was seen.
Like a thief I took one from the ground. Oh, of me it was so mean.
Seeing nothing on the way, I was rushing far away.
I was burning in the fire, would I get through all that mire?
Time was endless, so I thought, looked around, her I sought. 
What I saw was awful, scary. I was followed by the fairy.
«Will you stop? Don’t run away! How unlucky is the day!»
Shouting she was chasing in a line. «Don’t you know the comb is mine?»
I was trying to escape, she was roaring like an ape. 
In the field I was alone, being followed by her moan.
Running this way so fast, came the village into view at last. 
Soon the dogs began to bark, it was such a nice good mark.
«Bow-wow-wow», — the dogs were barking, after her they all were darting, 
«Now it’s your turn, be afraid, good-for-nothing ugly maid».
So the business being settled, though the creature was too nettled; 
I achieved my evil goal. Heavens! I was on a roll!
On my coming to my place, rushing home at such a pace, 
Told my mum I with a burst that enormous was my thirst.
I showed her a comb of gold, tried to look so brave and bold, 
Words of mine that it was found seemed to her to have no ground.
Farewell! The sun went down and at once I went to bed. 
I was lucky not to drown. Thanks to God I wasn’t dead.
While I was upon my pillow, sleep did not befall on me.
I heard knocking at the window. Oh, my God, I wished to flee.
Notwithstanding all that noise, I behaved like real boys.
But my mum was soon awake, would she know I was a fake?
«Who is there making dogs to bark? Who is walking in the dark? 
Decent people stay at home, night is not the time to roam!»
«People call me Water Maid and of gold my combs are made. 
One was stolen by your boy, give it back, it’s not a toy!»
In the sky the moon was bright. I was left by all my might. 
Trembling I lay in my bed. If I could, I would have fled.
She was knocking all the time. Her concern was very prime. 
Water dropped from her long hair, was she only my nightmare?
Mother quickly took the comb, threw away it from my home. 
Prompt she was to lock the door, she wished troubles no more.
When we got rid of the maid, to the Lord she humbly prayed. 
Then she scolded me in time, stealing things was such a crime.
Since that time I understood, let it be a thing or food,
Not to touch and not to take what was left not for my sake."
"Gabdulla Tukay    Shuraleh","I
In vicinity of Kazan there’s a village named Kyrlai,
Their chorus is the mightiest when its cocks in loud cry.
Not that born was I in Kyrlai, but I stayed there for a while,
Hard at work with harrowing, sowing, harvesting — all in due time.
I remember thick black forest, by the village like a wall,
I remember field and lawn, soft as velvet in the dawn.
Would you think that village’s big? — No, my dear, not at all.
Here is fresh water taken from the cheerful spring hole.
Air isn’t cold or hot — it’s all comfortable there.
When the raspberry — strawberry paint red the nearest lawn,
In a blink of eye your pail will be filled with their lot!
Fascinating land! Pines, fir-trees like the guardians stay alert,
Often used to rest beneath them, turning powerful twice more.
Here or there seeing mushrooms, sorrel, buds or flowers’ blossom
Under birch or aspen-tree — having been obsessed too close to them
Such a balmy air’s here from those blooming fragrancies,
Colored blue and colored yellow, variegated red, white, lilac!
And so motley butterflies are, making rivalry to bloom,
Flying, taking off and coming, — fed with nectar are they all!
And you feel sometimes as if birds of Paradise are singing,
Making heart stop sweetly still, and your soul wings do quiver.
All in one place, here they are! — theater, orchestra and ballet,
Concert, circus, boulevard — all that makes you ever jolly!
Huge as Khan Chingiz’s troops, like the giant with thousands heads
Endless forest starting there, as deep ocean rise in waves.
I see through the ancient time, our forefathers lived in,
Their glory, their names, lovely stories, lovely views
Of their honorable state.
As if curtains on the stage open are again
And at last you see them all, wondering what we are now —
Still, we are the sons of Lord blessed!
II
I described the summer beauties, — autumn, winter are ahead.
Maids innocent and black eyes will be featured a bit later.
Sabantui celebrations, horse race, holidays on site
If I each of them remember, I’ll be too far from my path.
Well, you see, that I’m diverted, thinking of the village fun,
Would you tell me what’s the title? — «Shuraleh» is signed above.
Wait a minute, please, my dear, friend of mine, you see my puzzle
In the moment when the village views again come into my mind.
III
And of course, that dense thick forest as we see it nearby
Is a home to wolves and foxes — every beast of pray alive.
Here a bear is sure to meet you, if you hunt him in a brake,
These are common things to hunter — seeing hare, facing elk.
But they say, black forest’s homeland for the evil spirit crew:
Devils, werewolves and goblins, shuralehs are frequent, too.
Why not? Endless forest shows miracles, as do the skies —
Many miracles in heaven, never seen and never tried!
IV
That’s a nice start to my story — small narration that I tell:
It was summer full-moon evening, when Dzhigit left home, he dwelt,
Making horse-way to the forest — needs some firewood to get.
Stars were twinkling in the sky, horse was mettlesome, indeed —
In a blink the dense drew nearer, and Dzhigit was inside it.
Fascinating silence seized him, when he looked around, amazed.
Dzhigit took to work at once, cutting firewood with ax.
Oh, indeed, Dzhigit was master of his job, and quick at work,
Night was flying by, invisible, as his ax was cutting log.
Taken breath was light and free, and cool air braced Dzhigit,
Ax in hand, — and there was nothing to retard him in his deed.
Suddenly, the tranquil air has been broken by a cry,
And the woodcutter has shuddered, as if bitten by a fly.
Then he stood alert, all ear, to see Something on the path —
Was it spirit or a human, or a werewolf’s black mouth?
Who was that disgusting monster, smiling such an awful smile?
Ugly nose of the being touched his chin, as long as knife.
Long thin hair of a beard, knotty all from top to toe,
Deep black eyes without eyelids were sparkling as a coal.
He was somewhat like a human, thin and lean, — if not a horn,
Black horn, finger-size was leaning, middle forehead sticking on.
Neither daylight, nor in night-time could you stand his look — God save!
Though his crooked arms had the fingers, straight and long as are the nails.
V
So they stared at each other for a long time, and Dzhigit
Bravely asked the ugly being: «Who are you and what’s your wish?»
«Don’t be scared, you, the human, I am not an outlaw.
Nor as innocent as baby, -1 am used to cheat you all.
When I see the lone person in the forest — tickle guy,
Now I see that you are single, and I dance for joy and cry!
Show me your fingers quickly, let me closer to ‘see,
You’ll play titi-titi-titi — titillating game with me!»
«Well, I’m not against at all, no objections but at first
Meet my will, it’s not as big…» — «Tell me everything you want.
I’m at your disposal, only hurry up, I’ll keep my word».
«Well, I see that you agree with my offer, — learn it now:
See that heavy fir-tree beam? If I help you, on your turn
Will you take it to my truck?
Beam is chopped on your side — easy carry, easy go!
Take the log by split and thus let us draw it on the slow.
Have you caught idea? — then hurry up, you, timber-cow!»
Shuraleh has followed strictly orders told him by Dzhigit,
Quickly fixed his fingers in long and deep split of the beam.
Now I think, you are aware, what woodcutter plotted on:
There was a wooden wedge in open mouth of the log.
Sly Dzhigit was very tricky, slightly hammering his ax.
Shuraleh was quite submissive, sure that he winner was.
Wooden wedge was loosened free by the knocks of ax at last,
Shuraleh’s ten fingers were clutched by the beam — so fast!
That was moment, Shuraleh cried of pain and saw the trick,
Pleading with his forest brothers to release him in a blink.
Shuraleh was begging Dzhigit, praying him as saint:
«Oh Batyr, release, forgive me, save me for God’s sake!
Swear you, oh mighty human, forward since today
I shall serve your will and never dare to attack!
And your progeny and offspring never be unsafe,
And my brothers in the forest will take care of them.
Strolling in the forest never will be blame.
Let’s make peace, you see, enough I am chastised, bless you God!
Do you like my troubles and pains?» — suffered poor creature, crawled.
Silently Dzhigit was leaving for his home without a word,
Seeing no other reason in the monster’s screams and oath.
Holding horse by bridle gently, stepped he forward, free to act…
Seeing that he wouldn’t follow him, Shuraleh said in despair:
«Pitiless you are and hostile to the peaceful Shuraleh,
Only thing before you leave — tell me name of yours, Dzhigit!
Hope, that hearing my voice, brothers rescue me tomorrow —
If me only to survive — then they ask the name of wrongdoer».
«Well, calm down and be quiet, — said the daredevil boldly, —
«Past» my name is, understood? I should be your elder brother.
Now I’m leaving, say good-bye, and don’t worry, cheer up!»
Shuraleh still screaming, weeping asked for pity more and more,
Pleading, threatening, entreating, loosing head of grief and sorrow:
«Help! Release me from the split! Crime against me is sure —
Past has squeezed my fingers, cheat! Devil, gangster, killed me, poor!»
In the dawn the shuralehs came to see him on the place:
«Crazy, silly, senseless creature, long and loud is your cry,
Shut your mouth and be silent, for your screams too stupid are,
Squeezed your fingers in the past, then why are crying you at moment?!»"
"Gabdulla Tukay    Mother’ prayer","Evening comes to the Tatar village; the magic bright moon is in the sky
Under its light all seems silver: houses, roofs, fields nearby
Very silent. Working people fell asleep because they’re tired
From the sunrise till the sunset they are working very hard
Any sound heard around, even barking of the dogs
But in one house in the suburb a little trembling light still burns
An old woman in that house has knelt down on a prayer rug
And her soul is soaring now very high in heavens’ hug
She has raised her hands in prayer and her wish is only one
She is whispering with devotion asking God to bless her son
Bitter tears are slowly rolling down her wrinkled face
Do you really suppose that God will not shed His grace?"
