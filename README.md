# AI-Generated Poems in an Indigenous Language

This project explores a Tatar language. The project focuses on creating a model that would generate poetry in Tatar based on the dataset I scrapped. 


The are 2 datasets of the Tatar poems: in english and in Tatar. And htere are 2 models: one was created by me and trained on the egnlish dataset and the other one used a pre-trained GPT-2 model and was trained on the tatar dataset. 

The repository also contains all of the pdf texts I scrapped for my tatar dataset.
